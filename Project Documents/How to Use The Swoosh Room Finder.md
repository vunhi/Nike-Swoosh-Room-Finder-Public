# How to use the Swoosh Room Finder

## Feature 1 - Interactive Campus Map 
The home page is an interactive campus map of the Nike Headquarters campus in Beaverton Oregon. The user can click on a building which will by default navigate to a floor plan of that building's first floor. Once the user gets to the activity page that displays the floor plan, they can further choose other rooms to display for that floor plan or they can choose different floors and floor rooms for that building. When a room is chosen in the room drop down menu a location marker appears on the floor plan indicating where the room is in the floor. On this same page the user can click on the "Building Location" icon to also display a pop up map showing where this building is on the campus map if they want. To exit out of this pop up map the user can click on the "X" on the pop up dialog or click outside of it. 

The user can also zoom in on the campus map or floor plan images to view the image closer or they can navigate to another activity page through the bottom navigation toolbar. There are 3 options: "Home" (the interactive campus map), "Search", and "Favorites." The functionality of the two latter sections will be described in the sections below. There is also an additional satellite view option that will provide a satellite view of the campus map. To enable the satellite view, click on the satellite view icon on the campus map home screen. 

Currently all buildings can be selected but the two with official Nike Floor Plans are Pete Sampras and the Tiger Woods Center. 

## Feature 2 - Search Functionality 
The search page allows the user to search for a specific room in the campus (or what is currently available). Before the user enters in any text to search, there is a list populated of the current buildings and rooms in the search list that they can search for. In the search list the building names are color coded in either neon green or orange (depending on the color theme chosen). The buildings are sorted in alphabetical order with their respective rooms also listed in alphabetical order. This list is scrollable. 

The user can either enter in a value to filter out the search results or directly click on a result as they see fit. Clicking on a value in the search list takes you to an activity page that displays the floor plan for that selection, the same activity page that the user can navigate to through the campus map. 

## Feature 3 - Favorites page 
On the page that displays the floor plan images there is another icon besides the "Building Location" icon previously mentioned and that is the "Add to Favorites" icon. Clicking on this icon gives the user the option to save a specific location to their Favorites page. The location can be saved under its actual location (Ex: Mia Hamm Floor 1 Flyknit) or under an alias that the user gives it. This Favorites page has a list of locations that the user previously added. It starts out as empty ("No favorites added") and then can be added to depending on the user's personal preferences. Clicking on a location in this list takes you to the the same floor plan activity page that can be reached through the interactive campus map or search pages. 

The first time the user opens the Favorites page an instruction pop up dialog appears letting them know how to utilize this page. If they simply click on a location it will take them to its floor plan. If they hold down on the location it will remove the location from the list. Clicking on the "Clear all favorites" icon clears the list of favorites. This list persists through every use of the app. If the user closes and reopens the app their favorites list should still be there. 

## Feature 4 - Sharing a location 
A user can also share a location with a user outside of the application. To do so navigate to the floor plan page for a building/room. On that floor plan activity page click on the "Share Location" icon. Then choose which method you would like to use to share with (Email, text message, etc). A screenshot of the floor plan image for the building/roomm that the app user is viewing as well as a campus map image with that building highlighted on it will be shared with a user outside of the application with a default message of "I would like to share this location with you" and, for email, a default subject of "Sharing Nike Campus Location." 

## Feature 5 - Changing Color Themes 
A user can choose between two classic Nike color schemes for the application: Nike Orange or Nike Neon Green. To change the color scheme for the theme click on the Nike swoosh logo above the header of the activity page then select your color choice and hit submit. The color changes will be enacted immediately and will persist for each use of the app until the user changes their color preference again.
